Computing oriented minimum bounding boxes in 2D
===============================================

This is the implementation accompanying my blog post on computing oriented minimum bounding boxes (OMBBs) in two dimensions (visit http://geidav.wordpress.com). The code implements the *Rotating Calipers* algorithm to compute OMBBs based on a convex hull. The *Gift Wrapping* algorithm is used for computing the convex hull. The code is written in Javascript and should run in any HTML5 compatible browser.
