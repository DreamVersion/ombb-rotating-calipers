Computing oriented minimum bounding boxes in 2D
===============================================

This is the implementation accompanying my blog post on computing oriented minimum bounding boxes (OMBBs) in two dimensions (visit http://geidav.wordpress.com). The code implements the *Gift Wrapping* algorithm for computing convex hulls and the Rotating Calipers algorithm to compute OMBBs. The code is written in Javascript and should run in any HTML5 compatible browser.
